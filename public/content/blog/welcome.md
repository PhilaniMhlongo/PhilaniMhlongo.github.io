#  Welcome to My DevOps Journey

**welcome to my corner of the internet.**

This blog is my digital notebook, where I’ll be documenting my journey of doing **DevOps** — not just as a career path, but as a mindset and philosophy of building modern, scalable, and reliable systems.

## 🌱 Why DevOps?

I’ve always been fascinated by how things work under the hood. As I explored software engineering, I found myself drawn toward the intersection of development and operations. The idea of automating infrastructure, enabling continuous delivery, and monitoring systems in real time felt like the perfect blend of problem-solving, engineering, and creativity.

DevOps empowers developers and teams to ship faster, with confidence and that’s something I’m deeply passionate about.

## 🧰 What You'll Find Here

This blog will serve as a public journal. I’ll be sharing:


- **Code snippets** on tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Jenkins**
- **Mistakes I make** (and what I learn from them)
- **Tips, tools, and tricks** to make DevOps easier and more fun

## 🔍 Current Focus

Right now, I’m deep-diving into:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform  
- Automating provisioning with Ansible  
- Building CI/CD pipelines from scratch  
- Deploying and managing workloads in Kubernetes  
- Setting up observability with Prometheus and Grafana

## ✨ Why Share This?

Writing things down helps me learn better. Sharing it publicly keeps me accountable. And if any of this helps someone else who’s on the same path even better.

Whether you’re new to DevOps or a seasoned engineer, I hope you’ll find something useful here or even reach out and share what you’re learning too.

Let’s grow together.
